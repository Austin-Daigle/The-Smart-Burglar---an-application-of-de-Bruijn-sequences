# The Smart Burglar: an application of De Bruijn sequences

## Abstract:
This project's focus is to develop an algorithmic process to create a string of 10,003 numerical characters that tests all possible combinations on a four-digit (zero through nine) electronic combination lock. The advantage of this process would save an enormous amount of time when testing hardware or gaining unauthorized access into secured equipment or locations; because, instead of entering 40,000 characters to test all 10,000 possible combinations, you would instead only need to enter 10,003 characters; thus, increasing your efficiency by nearly three-fold (Berry).
